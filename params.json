You're from a whole 'nother world, different dimension. You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy. Pop your confetti.\r\n\r\nI'm walking on air (tonight). You don't have to feel like a wasted space. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your popsicle. I finally found you my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete. But I will get there. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy. If I had a nickel for everytime, I'd own the bank. We freak in my jeep, Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo. Oh no, did I get too close? It's time to bring out the big balloons. I can see the writing on the wall. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above.\r\n\r\nYou're original, cannot be replaced. Had the world in the palm of your hands. We go higher and higher. Woo! Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up above. Respect. 'Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar louder, louder than a lion. If you get the chance you better keep her. Last Friday night we went streaking in the park. It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called. Think the city towed my car, chandeliers on the floor. I wanna walk on your wave length and be there when you vibrate\r\n\r\nThe girl's a freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna Beach. Boy, when you're with me I'll give you a taste. I'll take your bad days with your good. There is no fear now, let go and just be free, I will love you unconditionally. Yeah, she dances to her own beat. Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a bitch. Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Like a bird without a cage. But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy.",
